## Project Description
This project is a simulation app that allows users to create scenarios and vehicles. A scenario can have multiple vehicles, and vehicles can move based on their speed and direction when the simulation starts. The data is stored in a JSON file and managed using a Node.js server. The frontend is built with React.js and communicates with the backend via RESTful API calls.
